## ‚ú® About The Project

AI-FitAdvisor is not just another fitness tracker. It's a smart, personalized fitness companion designed to help users achieve their health goals effectively. By leveraging the power of Generative AI, this platform provides tailored workout plans and dietary suggestions that adapt to the user's progress and preferences in real-time.

Built on a robust and scalable **Microservice Architecture**, the system is designed for high availability, independent deployment of services, and seamless scalability.

## üéØ Key Features

* ü§ñ **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Integrates with the **Gemini AI API** to generate dynamic, personalized workout and fitness plans based on user data and goals.
* üîê **Secure Authentication & Authorization**: Utilizes **Keycloak** for rock-solid security, providing role-based access control (RBAC) and protecting user data across all microservices.
* üìà **Comprehensive Activity Tracking**: Allows users to log workouts, track progress, monitor metrics, and visualize their fitness journey over time.
* ‚ö° **Asynchronous Communication**: Employs **RabbitMQ** as a message broker to ensure reliable, asynchronous communication between microservices, enhancing system resilience and responsiveness.
* üê≥ **Containerized Deployment**: Fully containerized with **Docker**, allowing for consistent development environments and simplified deployment.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Modular & Scalable**: Developed with a **Microservice Architecture**, enabling services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.


## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, decoupled microservices architecture. The core services communicate both synchronously via REST APIs and asynchronously via a message queue.
