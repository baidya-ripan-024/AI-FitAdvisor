to work with rabbitmq

1. visit the rabbitmq official page then go to install and upgrade section.
we can install the rabbitmq in our machine. but here, we will prefer to work with docker. here is the docker command we need to run

command::
# latest RabbitMQ 4.x
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:4-management

here, the command says that, run the a docker command in iterative mode(-it), use --rm means the container will automatically removed
once the program has terminate. give a name to the container, set port for rabbitmq, set port for rabbitmq dashboard, then provide the image


2. after run the command go to the rabbitmq dashboard
http://localhost:15672
provide username and password and its 'guest' by default


3. activity service will work as a publisher
